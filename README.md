Firstly that my first web app ever, that's why there is so much files.
the web app "Menu des Cultures" is for seamless international restaurant table reservations, with real-time booking and a user-friendly design.
the "Reservation" section is coded with php (html included) so to run u need to start a PHP local server like Xamp, Wamp, Mamp ...,
and prepare the database using "reservation.sql" , u know what u gotta do... .
